# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for implementing advanced database features in the Sorami language learning platform. The system will migrate from a simple SQLite database to a comprehensive PostgreSQL database with advanced features including user management, content management, JLPT exam system, spaced repetition system, course curriculum, graph relationships, analytics, study activities, notifications, and data import/export capabilities.

1. WHEN I request practice questions THEN the system SHALL provide questions filtered by JLPT level and type
2. WHEN I complete a practice test THEN the system SHALL calculate my score and identify weak areas
3. WHEN I answer questions THEN the system SHALL track my performance and response times
4. WHEN I need study recommendations THEN the system SHALL suggest content based on my weak areas
5. IF I want a mock exam THEN the system SHALL generate a full-length practice test with realistic conditions

### Requirement 4: Spaced Repetition System (SRS)

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want an intelligent spaced repetition system that schedules reviews based on my performance, so that I can optimize my learning retention and efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review an item correctly THEN the system SHALL increase the review interval using SRS algorithm
2. WHEN I review an item incorrectly THEN the system SHALL reset the interval to ensure more frequent practice
3. WHEN items are due for review THEN the system SHALL present them in order of priority
4. WHEN I complete study sessions THEN the system SHALL update progress and calculate next review dates
5. IF I have daily review targets THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate number of items for review

### Requirement 5: Course Curriculum System

**User Story:** As a learner, I want structured courses with hierarchical units and lessons that guide my learning progression, so that I can follow a systematic path through the Japanese language curriculum.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enroll in a course THEN the system SHALL track my progress through units and lessons
2. WHEN I complete a unit THEN the system SHALL unlock the next unit in the sequence
3. WHEN I access course content THEN the system SHALL show my current position and next recommended steps
4. WHEN prerequisites are not met THEN the system SHALL prevent access to advanced content
5. IF I want to see my progress THEN the system SHALL display completion percentages and achievements

### Requirement 6: Graph Relationship System

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to discover relationships between different learning content (words, kanji, grammar) through a graph-based system, so that I can understand connections and get personalized recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view content THEN the system SHALL show related items through graph relationships
2. WHEN I study content THEN the system SHALL recommend related items based on graph connections
3. WHEN content relationships exist THEN the system SHALL enable network traversal and discovery
4. WHEN I need learning paths THEN the system SHALL generate optimal sequences through related content
5. IF content has components THEN the system SHALL show hierarchical relationships (e.g., kanji components)

### Requirement 7: Analytics and Reporting System

**User Story:** As a learner and administrator, I want comprehensive analytics on learning progress, user behavior, and content performance, so that I can track improvement and optimize the learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access analytics THEN the system SHALL show learning progress, session statistics, and performance metrics
2. WHEN I complete study activities THEN the system SHALL track and analyze my behavior patterns
3. WHEN content is used THEN the system SHALL measure content effectiveness and difficulty
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL provide insights on weak areas and recommendations
5. IF I want data export THEN the system SHALL provide analytics data in standard formats

### Requirement 8: Study Activities System

**User Story:** As a learner, I want diverse study activities including flashcards, writing practice, listening exercises, and interactive games, so that I can engage with content through multiple learning modalities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a study session THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate activities based on my level and preferences
2. WHEN I practice writing THEN the system SHALL track stroke accuracy and provide feedback
3. WHEN I do listening exercises THEN the system SHALL play audio and evaluate my comprehension
4. WHEN I use flashcards THEN the system SHALL adapt difficulty based on my performance
5. IF I complete activities THEN the system SHALL record results and update my progress

### Requirement 9: Notification System

**User Story:** As a learner, I want personalized notifications for study reminders, progress updates, and achievements, so that I stay engaged and motivated in my learning journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN items are due for review THEN the system SHALL send study reminder notifications
2. WHEN I achieve milestones THEN the system SHALL notify me of accomplishments and progress
3. WHEN I set notification preferences THEN the system SHALL respect my channel and frequency choices
4. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL track engagement and optimize timing
5. IF I'm inactive THEN the system SHALL send appropriate re-engagement notifications

### Requirement 10: Data Import/Export System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive data import/export capabilities for content migration, backup, and external integrations, so that I can manage data effectively and ensure system reliability.
