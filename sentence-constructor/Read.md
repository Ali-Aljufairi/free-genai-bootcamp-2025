# Japanese Sentence Constructor

## Difficulty
Level 100

## Business Goal
A chat agent acting as a teaching assistant to guide students from translating an English sentence into Japaneseâ€”providing guidance without giving direct answers.

## Discussion
Will AI-Powered Assistants replace real teachers?

## Technical Uncertainty
- How well can an AI-Powered Assistant perform a very broad task?
 
```bash
I Think it will do good job but I dont think it will be able to replace real teachers and some
japanese sentences I am instrested in  comparining reasoing Ai powered assistant compared with model without reasoning I want to see how well they perform I think model wil peform better when they reasoning is involved 
```
  
- Would a very broad task be better performed by dividing it into subtasks with specialized agents?

```bash 
 I think for sentence contrustion I dont think it will be better  to divide it into steps  because the sentence contrucation the setnence is realated toe ach other and I need and the model needs to think have all of the context to be able to construct the setneces  
```

- Does using an AI-Powered Assistant provide a good avenue for rapid prototyping of agents?

```bash
 I think for my assumption that it will be able to do this and it will be fine for quick prototyping yes it willb e good and just to show the proof of concept but I think it will be hard to scale it up for production use case because they could husslainte which need to be hard
```

- How could we reimplement the agent from the AI-Powered Assistant into a stack that integrates directly with our platform?

```bash 
Yes we can we have already been tuaaght in genai essitain l course and we can use some of the techquines we have bene tagught there to be able to do this  
```

- How much do we need to rework our prompt documents from one AI-Powered Assistant to another?
```bash 
I dont know the anser yes and will try to find out the answer for that 
``` 

- What prompting techniques can we naturally discover within the confines of an AI-Powered Assistant?

- Are there any innovations unique to specific AI-Powered Assistants four business goal?

- What outcomes can we achieve given our AI-Powered Assistant choice against our hardware or budget limitations?
