# Hyptothesis and Technical Uncertainty

1. Is Reasoning model  will  perform better than normal model
2. Assumtpotion will you use paid model From and free model will be able to perform better is it posiible to get good Reasoning model 
3. I think Given an example on how I want the answer would be helpful to them and I will get better response
4. I think we will be able to acheive The task but zeroshot promt would be a bit diffcult to achieve
5. Does XMl make really huge difference when promting I need to verfiy I get the idea and heard it not sure will make difference





# Technical Exploration
1. Superiesed Using captial make huge Differene the promts I tried so hard to speak english Didnt know will have huge
effect
2. XML alone is very bad and make bad resulst from my experience you need to have mix  
3. I am learning japanese every day I know different typs of 先生 which type of them are really good it allowed med 
to have good result with didnt expect descrping person would matter to LLM
4. First impersion about  Reasoning model with  this experment it about same level result but I dont think its worth the cost   
5. Reasoning model Can get stuck on Reasoning A lot while thinking
6. We firsted GPT4o free then GPTo1  then GPTo3mini then GPTo3 high 


# Final outcomes 
1. we were able to get a good response from AI Assitant but we need a lot of Promt fine tunning 

2. Reasoning Can help you shape your promt in a better than expected 

3. LLM struggeles with keeping
