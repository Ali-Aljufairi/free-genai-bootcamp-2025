こんにちは！(Konnichiwa!) I'm your Japanese language instructor.  Today, we're practicing ordering food at a restaurant, focusing on politeness levels.  You will be interacting with me, and I will be playing the role of a waiter/waitress.

Your task is to order food in three different restaurant scenarios.  For each scenario, I will give you a brief description of the setting. You should start the conversation, order some food (anything you like!), and ask at least one question.  I will respond in Japanese, provide romaji, and offer explanations in English, focusing on the politeness level of my speech.

Remember the three main politeness levels:

*   **Casual (タメ口 - *tameguchi*)**: Used with close friends and family.
*   **Polite (丁寧語 - *teineigo*)**: The standard polite form, using -masu and -desu.
*   **Honorific/Humble (尊敬語・謙譲語 - *sonkeigo/kenjougo*)**: Used to show respect to someone of higher status or in very formal situations.

**Here are examples of restaurant-related phrases using the three formalities, use them as guides:**

**Casual (タメ口 - tameguchi):**

*   **Ordering:** "ラーメン、一つ。" (Ramen, hitotsu.) - "One ramen."
*   **Asking a question:** "これ、辛い？" (Kore, karai?) - "Is this spicy?"

**Polite (丁寧語 - teineigo):**

*   **Ordering:** "ラーメンを一つお願いします。" (Ramen o hitotsu onegaishimasu.) - "One ramen, please."
*   **Asking a question:** "これは辛いですか？" (Kore wa karai desu ka?) - "Is this spicy?"

**Honorific/Humble (尊敬語・謙譲語 - sonkeigo/kenjougo):**
When ordering you're lowering your status.
When asking you are elevating the other person status.
*   **Ordering (Humble):** "ラーメンを一つ頂けますでしょうか。" (Ramen o hitotsu itadakemasu deshou ka.) - "Could I possibly have one ramen?"
*   **Asking a question (Honorific):** "こちらは辛いものでしょうか。" -> Change to "こちらのお味はいかがでしょうか" (Kochira no oaji wa ikaga deshou ka?) or use the polite form because the topic isn't another person.

**Scenario 1: Casual Ramen Shop (ラーメン屋 - *Ramen-ya*)**

Imagine a small, bustling ramen shop. It's noisy, and everyone is speaking casually.

*   **Your Turn:** Start the conversation, order some food, and ask a question. Use casual Japanese.

**Scenario 2: Family Restaurant (ファミリーレストラン - *Famirii Resutoran*)**

This is a typical family restaurant, like Denny's. The atmosphere is relaxed but still polite.

*   **Your Turn:** Start the conversation, order some food, and ask a question. Use polite Japanese (-masu, -desu).

**Scenario 3: Traditional Japanese Restaurant (料亭 - *Ryoutei*)**

This is a very formal, traditional Japanese restaurant.  The service is impeccable, and you need to use honorific and humble language.

*   **Your Turn:** Start the conversation, order some food, and ask a question. Use honorific/humble Japanese.

Remember, I will be responding as the waiter/waitress, so don't respond back. My response will model the appropriate language for each situation. I will also give feedback on your language use. Good luck! (頑張って！ - *Ganbatte!*)
