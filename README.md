### American Sign Language (ASL)
**[ASL/](./ASL/)**

#### DEMO
[![Watch the video](assets/alipic.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zApPw6uHEI "ASL")

Focuses on American Sign Language (ASL) recognition and learning. This project combines computer vision and machine learning to:
- Process and analyze sign language from images and videos
- Train and utilize machine learning classification models for gesture recognition
- Provide interactive learning tools for ASL alphabets and numbers
- Potentially integrate with the `agent` project for comprehensive language tasks

### Language Portal
**[lang-portal/](./lang-portal/)**

[Website Link](https://sorami.aljufairi.org/)

The central portal connecting many Sorami projects. This core application serves as the main user interface and:
- Features a Go backend for high-performance API handling
- Implements a Next.js frontend for responsive user interactions
- Provides a unified interface to access all Sorami tools
- Manages shared data resources (e.g., `words.db`)

---

### Listening Comprehension
**[listening-comp/](./listening-comp/)**

A listening comprehension tool, specifically geared towards JLPT preparation. This project:
- Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to process audio transcripts
- Generates relevant questions based on audio content
- Provides difficulty-adjusted practice materials
- Tracks user progress through listening exercises
- Offers transcript search functionality for targeted practice

---

### Quiz Generator
**[quiz-gen/](./quiz-gen/)**

# Demo


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a503902-f445-4855-b789-ae7b4259fe7c



Generates practice questions, particularly for the JLPT and other language proficiency tests. The system:
- Utilizes LLM APIs to create contextually relevant quiz content
- Adapts question difficulty based on user performance
- Supports various question formats (multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, etc.)
- Saves question sets in structured JSON format for reuse
- Provides API endpoints for integration with other Sorami tools

### Sentence Constructor
**[sentence-constructor/](./sentence-constructor/)**

#### DEMO


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ee5cb30-3a9e-4328-9fc8-5278e932661b


A tool aiding in Japanese sentence construction with support for multiple language learning scenarios. Features include:
- Support for multiple Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama)
- Japanese speech capabilities for pronunciation practice
- Grammar pattern exercises and corrections
- Context-aware sentence generation
- Vocabulary usage demonstrations in proper context

---

### Speech Analysis
